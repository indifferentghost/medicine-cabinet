Here's the app:
Simple medicine cabinet,
search for "prescriptions"
have a static list of prescriptions on the backend (fake data)
hit api to return your search
show it to the user in a "prescription card"
allow them to save it to their medicine cabinet
show them their medicine cabinet, allow delete
I'd like you to save it in a database, but dont worry about spinning up a real database, just write the code for it and maybe stub it out.
Ideal stack, nextjs tailwind typescript, postgres or mongo, whichever.
Try not to spend more than 8 hours on it if possible.
try to build it to be semi real from a user perspective, add fun tailwind components, etc etc, put some thought into the page itself. its as much a front end task as it is a backend.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
